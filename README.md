## How to add a new problem

1. Create a new file in `src/problems/` directory with the name of the problem in snake_case with format
   `pNNNN_problem_title.rs`, where `NNNN` is the number of the problem on LeetCode in 4-digit format with leading zeros
   and `problem_title` is the name of the problem in snake_case.

2. Use the following template for the file:

```rust
//! # LeetCode Problem: [Problem Number] - [Problem Title]
//!
//! Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
//!
//! Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/[problem-slug]/
//!
//! ## Complexity Analysis
//! - Time Complexity: O(n) - Describe the time complexity of your solution.
//! - Space Complexity: O(n) - Describe the space complexity of your solution.

pub struct Solution;

// Copy the problem title from LeetCode
impl Solution {
    pub fn problem_title() {
        // Your solution here
    }
}

// Tests are written in the same file and are mandatory
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::Solution;

    #[test]
    fn test_problem_title() {
        // Your tests here
    }
}
```

Complexity analysis is optional but recommended. If you're not sure about the complexity of your solution,
you can leave it out.

3. Update the `lib.rs` file to include the new problem file. Add the following line at the end of the file:

```rust
pub mod pNNNN_problem_title;
```

4. Add the problem to the [Problems](#problems) table in `README.md`
5. Run the tests with `cargo test` to make sure everything is working.
6. Commit your changes.
